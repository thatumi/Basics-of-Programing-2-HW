# Basics of Programming 2 (Budapest University of Technology and Economics) Homework

This is a command-line game created for the Basics of Programming 2 course.

The objective of the game is to defeat a bat and an archer.

After the first round, items spawn, allowing us to replenish our health and HP.

In the command line, you can see what actions you can take at each step, and there is also documentation available.
